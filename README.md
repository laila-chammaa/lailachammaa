it's up! [lailachammaa.herokuapp.com](http://lailachammaa.herokuapp.com)


Designed and developed a personal website that was inspired by my love for music and writing using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, and Bootstrap. 

Implemented dynamic pages, user logins, sessions, and cookies.

Used web templating with Jinja and inheritance with python to remove repeated html code between pages.

Deployed as a Docker container on Heroku.

### Future Plans
Looks into why it's so slow!!
